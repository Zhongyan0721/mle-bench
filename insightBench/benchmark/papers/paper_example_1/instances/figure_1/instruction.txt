You are tasked with analyzing the data from Figure 1 of the paper "Example Paper 1". 

The data represents a time series of measurements taken from an experiment. Your task is to:

1. Identify any trends or patterns in the data
2. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the measurements
3. Determine if there are any outliers in the dataset
4. Provide a brief interpretation of what these results might mean in the context of the paper

The data is provided in the 'data' directory. Use the appropriate tools to load and analyze this data.

Your conclusions should be structured as a JSON object with the following keys:
- "trends": A list of identified trends or patterns
- "statistics": An object containing the mean, median, and standard deviation
- "outliers": A list of identified outliers (if any)
- "interpretation": A brief textual interpretation of the results
